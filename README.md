# Integration-Championship

Hello! I'm Iuri and I'm a n00b in programming languages! I love mathematics and I do know some LaTeX, but am on my first steps on python.

My aim with this is to create in my uni a Calculus Championship. The program should sort out from a big set of integrals some for two students to "battle".

It is HIGHLY inspirated on MIT INTEGRATION BEE.

Any help would be appreciated!
Thanks.
